# REACT ABOUT CARD

Live site [HERE] ()

This is my first React solo project. It was challenege from Scrimba. They provided us with a Figma design and let us code our card version entirely on our own. It was a pretty easy project because it was just a static page. I am looking forward to more complicated tasks.
