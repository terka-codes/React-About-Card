This is my first React solo project. 🥳 
It was challenege from Scrimba. They provided us with a Figma design and let us code our card version entirely on our own. It was a pretty easy project because it was just a static page. I am looking forward to more complicated tasks. 

Since there was so much design for the mobile version and it was my first React app, I only stuck to the desktop version. 🤷‍♀️
